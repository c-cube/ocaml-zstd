(* Encoding throughput: raw zstd vs seekable zstd at several frame sizes.

   The input is produced on the fly by a streaming [source] that pushes 64 KiB
   chunks to a consumer callback (no large buffer is ever materialised beyond
   the 32 MiB pattern). Each compressor's [write] is plugged in as the
   consumer. The compressed output is discarded but counted, so we also report
   the compression ratio and the framing overhead of the seekable format.

   Usage: bench_seekable [SIZE_MiB=2048] [LEVEL=3] *)

let mib = 1024 * 1024
let chunk_bytes = 64 * 1024
let frame_sizes_mib = [ 2; 4; 16 ]

(* A 32 MiB block of pseudo-randomly ordered lorem-ipsum words, built once.

   input rather than one giant match. *)
